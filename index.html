    <h3><span class="unimportant">How to cook a turkey </span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a pan without the roasting rack (the garlic head halves create the ‘rack’).</li>
        <li>Stuff the cavity with halved garlic heads, lemon slice (optional) and sprigs</li>
        <li>Tie the legs together and tuck the wings under its back to prevent the legs and wings from spreading out.</li>
        <li>You can wrap the wings tips in foil for the first half of roasting if the heating element in your oven is at the top,<br> or you have a small oven, or to prevent them from charring</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3> <span class="unimportant"> roasting </span></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Before roasting, slather it with garlic herb butter all over AND under the skin to help retain all of the juices. <br> I find melted butter works better to get all of those flavours evenly over the bird.</li>
        <li>Place turkey, breast-side down, over garlic, lemon and herbs. The aromatics will continuously cook <br> through the meat — from the inside and outside.</li>
        <li>Slather it with the garlic herb butter during the cooking process. This creates an incredible golden skin.</li>
        <li>Take your time. Don’t speed up the cooking process while roasting as it may cook unevenly.</li>
        <li>A meat thermometer is crucial to help you know exactly when your turkey is cooked through.</li>
    </ul>

            <h3> <span class="unimportant">  What temperature to cook a turkey </span></h3>
            <p>Roast the turkey, breast-side down, uncovered, at 390°F (200°C) for fan forced ovens, or 425°F (220°C for standard <br> ovens for 30 minutes. (For a turkey over 15 pounds, you will need 45 minutes.)</p>
            <p>Turn turkey over (breast-side up) with a clean bean towel or oven mits (heat-proof gloves) and baste with <br> pan juices.</p>
            <p>Slather with half of the butter and season with salt and pepper.</p>
            <p>Reduce heat to 325°F |165°C (for standard ovens), or 300°F | 150°C (fan-forced). Roast for a further hour.</p>
            <p>Brush turkey again with remaining butter and roast for 30 minutes. <br> Baste, then continue roasting for a further 30 minutes or so, depending on the size of your bird. For an extra large turkey, you may need an additional half hour to an hour.</p>
            <p>Use a meat thermometer inserted between the breast and leg. It should read 165°F | 75°C. This is the USDA <br> recommended internal cooked temperature of turkey.</p>
            <p>For extra crispy skin, broil in the last 5-10 minutes of cook time, keeping your eye on it so it doesn’t <br> burn.</p>
            <h3> <span class="unimportant"> how long to cook a turkey </span></h3>
            <p>Cooking time varies depending on a few things:</p>

    </div>
    <span class="important">
    <ol>
        <li>Turkey size. Generally, a turkey needs to cook for about 13-15 minutes per pound.</li>
        <li>Temperature of your turkey before roasting: If your turkey is cold and not close to room temperature  <br> when it goes into the oven, it will take longer to roast. If it is at room temp temperature, it may take less time.</li>
        <li>Your oven.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3> <span class="unimportant"> roasting time </span> </h3>
    <p> <span class="unimportant">Approximate times:</span> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>5kg:2hrs 15min</li>
        <li>6kg:2hrs 35-45mins</li>
        <li>7kg:3hrs</li>
        <li>8kg:3hrs 15-20mins</li>
        <li>9kg:3hrs 45-55mins</li>
        <li>10kg:4hrs 15-20min</li>
    </ul>
<h3> <span class="unimportant">allow it to rest</span> </h3>
<p>Once your turkey is cooked through, transfer it to a marble cutting board or serving plate. Tent with foil <br> to keep it warm, and allow it to rest for 15-30 minutes, depending on the size of the turkey (the bigger it is, the longer it will need to rest).</p>
